Gemma-2-2B,3.226,11,551,562,1e-06,0.00011,0.000111,0.617,"Here's a breakdown of what should be included in Milestone 1 of your project report, based on the provided context:

**1. Project Overview**

* **Introduction:** Briefly describe the project's goal, the dataset you're working with, and the overall problem you're trying to solve.
* **Data Description:**  Provide a concise summary of your dataset's characteristics (size, features, data types, etc.). Include any relevant information about data sources or preprocessing steps.

**2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

* **Data Exploration:**  Present a clear overview of your data exploration process. Include:
    * **Descriptive Statistics:**  Summarize key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for relevant features.
    * **Visualization:**  Use plots (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc.) to illustrate data distributions, relationships, and potential issues.
    * **Data Cleaning:**  Describe the steps you took to clean the data (handling missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, etc.). Include any code snippets or explanations.
    * **Feature Engineering:**  Explain the rationale behind any new features you created. Include code for feature engineering steps.

**3. Model Selection and Training**

* **Model Choice:**  Clearly state the model(s) you selected for your project. Justify your choice based on:
    * **Task Requirements:**  How does the model align with the specific goals of your project?
    * **Dataset Characteristics:**  How does the model's structure and complexity match the nature of your data?
    * **Previous Research:**  Are there any established models that are relevant to your problem?
* **Training Process:**  Describe the steps involved in training your model:
    * **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Explain how you tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
    * **Training and Validation:**  Describe how you split your data into training and validation sets.
    * **Metrics:**  Report the metrics you used to evaluate model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC).
    * **Training Progress:**  Include plots showing the model's performance over time during training.

**4. Evaluation and Analysis**

* **Evaluation Metrics:**  Clearly state the evaluation metrics you used (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,"
Mistral-7B,11.349,11,281,292,2e-06,0.000169,0.000171,0.526," For Milestone 1 of the project report, the following components should be included:

1. Data Cleaning: A description of the data cleaning process, including the rationale behind each step and evidence such as plots or numbers to support the choices made.
2. Data Analysis: An analysis of the data, including any insights gained and visualizations of the results.
3. Feature Selection: A description of the chosen features, the reason for their selection, and evidence to support the decision.
4. Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering: A description of the steps taken for data pre-processing and feature engineering, including the need for each step, its effect on the data distribution, and any performance reports.
5. Log Transform: A justification for why a log transform was used, including a comparison of the EDA results before and after the transform.
6. Correct Order and Documentation: A clear and logical order of steps with clear markdown explanations that justify the choices made.
7. Limitations: A report of the performance of the steps throughout training and validation, as well as on unseen test data, along with any limitations.
8. Inference Function: A description of the inference function used, including explanations of both the global and local explanations, and plots and explanations of the explanations in the report.

It is important to remember that each team member must be able to explain and justify every step in the report."
LLaMA-3.1-8B,6.439,11,463,474,3e-06,0.00037,0.000374,0.634,"Based on the provided context, the following should be included in the report for Milestone 1:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Explain and justify every step in the context of the project, including the need for each step and its effect on the data distribution, range, values, etc.
2. **Data Analysis**: Include plots and results from data-engineering questions, along with reasoning and justification.
3. **Plotting the results**: Include plots of the results for each step.
4. **Answering Data Engineering Questions**: Answer questions in a markdown in the notebook, and add it to the report.
5. **Feature Selection**: Explain the reason for the chosen features, report evidence, and plot the effect of the features.
6. **Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering**: Understand the step, need for the step, and effect on the data distribution, range, values, etc.
7. **Prediction Model**: Include the model choice, how it works, its limitations, reporting its performance throughout training and validation, and reporting its performance on the unseen test data.
8. **Inference Function**: Include XAI (Explainable AI), Global Explanation, Local Explanation, and plot and explain the explanations in the report.
9. **Comparative Results**: Compare multiple approaches, investigate more than one approach when trying to improve performance (different features, preprocessing pipelines, models, hyperparameters, etc.), and report comparative results.
10. **Baseline Requirement**: Include a baseline for architecture choices, with a clear explanation of the baseline and after results for the complete pipeline, and explain why the added step improved or worsened performance.

Additionally, the report should include:

* Correct order and documentation: Steps must follow logical order and include clear markdown explanations that justify choices.
* All plots and Data Engineering answers included: Every plot, result from data-engineering questions, and the reasoning/justification must be included.
* Evidence: Include plots, numbers, statistics, or references to experiments to support explanations.
* Justification: Justify every step, including the need for each step and its effect on the data distribution, range, values, etc."
