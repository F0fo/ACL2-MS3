Mistral-7B,5.75,8,140,148,2e-06,8.4e-05,8.6e-05,0.021," Based on the information provided, I cannot recommend the Kyo-to Grand hotel in Tokyo, Japan specifically as I don't have enough details about its average score, cleanliness, comfort, facilities, and location score. However, if a 5-star hotel in Tokyo, Japan is what you're looking for, I would suggest researching other highly-rated options in the city to find one that best fits your needs and preferences. Some popular 5-star hotels in Tokyo include the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo, The Ritz-Carlton, Tokyo, and The Shangri-La Hotel, Tokyo. I would recommend checking their individual reviews, amenities, and locations to help make your decision."
